Having the "quick look" tool HDFview is invaluable and can be downloaded from:

http://www.hdfgroup.org/downloads/index.html

The document International_Surface_Pressure_Data_Bank_format_v10_11.doc
describes in depth what is contained in the entire HDF file.

The document hdftotxt.doc describes each field that is found in the table 
Data/AssimilationFeedback/AssimilationFeedBack of the HDF files.

to run the hdftotxt program the environment variables must be set

setenv obsdirh5 "the location of the directory containing the directories YYYY"
                "with sub directory structure YYYY/MM/YYYYMMDDHH.h5"
setenv PERLLIB "the location of perl libraries"
setenv PERL5LIB "the location of 64bit perl libraries"

Then the following command would dump all the feedback data from January 1st YYYY at 0 hours

   h5ftotxt YYYY010100
