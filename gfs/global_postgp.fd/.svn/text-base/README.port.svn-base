* use standalone sgetmo.f
* remove rsearch1 from postgp, use standalone version that does not use
  xlf intrinsic extension.
* namelist read in from file in postgp.f, not from stdin (reading
  from stdin problematic with mpirun).
* change logical*1's to logical in postgp.f and mptran.f,
  replace MPI_LOGICAL1 with MPI_LOGICAL in mptran.f
